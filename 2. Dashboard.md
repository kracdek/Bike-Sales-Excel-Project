As we all know it's easy to compare data by visualisation than comparing numbers. 

Therefore Pivot charts are created. The pivort chart for the pivot tables in pivot table file are:

<img width="360" alt="Cummute distancee" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94454970/161389245-710d5eb6-fe1c-4b38-8c6f-ca5d3a006162.png">

<img width="359" alt="Customer age" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94454970/161389251-e9eb9d9b-8511-49a6-95d8-2f926e287093.png">



Now we can easily compare bike purchase count data in different age group and by distance.

## Dashboard

Dashboard is created by creating slicers to the pivot table for better comparison and visualisation as chart presentation changes with the slicer filter. We can join multiple slicers to multiple charts with the help of `Report Connections` to see the effect of filter on different charts.  

A simple dashboard for this project is shown below:
